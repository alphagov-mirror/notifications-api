    If any previous event hasn't sent yet for that provider, then we shouldn't send the current event. Instead, fail and

    replay the `send_broadcast_provider_message` task if the previous message has now been sent.

    Note: This is called before the new broadcast_provider_message is created.

    # Help, I've come across this code following a pagerduty alert, what should I do?

    1. Find the failing broadcast_provider_message associated with the previous event that caused this to trip.
    2. If that provider message is still failing to send, fix the issue causing that. The task to send that previous
       message might still be retrying in the background - look for logs related to that task.
    3. If that provider message has sent succesfully, you might need to send this task off depending on context. This
       might not always be true though, for example, it may not be necessary to send a cancel if the original alert has
       already expired.
    4. If you need to re-send this task off again, you'll need to run the following command on paas:
       `send_broadcast_provider_message.apply_async(args=(broadcast_event_id, provider), queue=QueueNames.BROADCASTS)`
